Mr. ___ is a ___ male with no past psychiatric or

Per Dr. ___ (___) ED Initial Psychiatry Consult note:

" Patient states that he has had depressed mood and feeling of
emptiness for past 3 weeks. He broke up with his girlfriend 3
weeks ago because he was feeling sad and empty. Since then, they
have been getting back together and breaking up again several
times. Patient states that this is causing him significant
distress. They have been dating for ___ years and he feels as if 
he
can't go on without her. He states, "I know I will never love
again." He endorses depressive symptoms, including hopelessness,
guilt, decreased sleep, decreased appetite. He states that he 
has
been sleeping only a few hours per night and has no appetite. 

Over the past 2 weeks, patient has had thoughts of killing
himself. He had planned to go to the roof of one of the ___
buildings and jump off. He called a suicide hotline last night
because he was feeling like he may go through with this plan, 
but
he states that no one picked up. He talked to his roommate about
this, and he made him feel a little better and stayed with him
throughout the night. This morning, patient states that he was
having serious thoughts of suicide. He texted his loved ones
goodbye messages. As he was walking to class, he crossed a T
track and stood in the middle of it as the train was coming
towards him. The driver honked and this startled him and made 
him
jump out of the way. Patient states that he had intended to die
and was upset that he got startled and moved out of the way at
the last second. Patient has history of previous suicidal
thoughts in high school when he was being bullied and stressed
out applying to college. He states that he has never had a plan
before, and has never attempted suicide. He states that in high
school when he felt sad and had thoughts of suicide, he had his
girlfriend to talk to. Now he feels alone and feels as if he may
hurt himself. He feels safe here in the emergency department and
denies any suicidal thoughts currently."

Upon arrival to the unit patient confirms the above history as
documented by Dr. ___ with the following additions: 

Patient states he feels "okay but anxious" and that he "feels
better knowing I am safe here". He reports that he has felt much
better since coming to the hospital and is beginning to feel 
like
"it is possible" to "picture a life" without his girlfriend. He
states that he is glad he is on the unit, even though he feels
somewhat anxious being here, because he doesn't feel safe at
present at home because there are "too many little memories" of
his girlfriend around his ___. He also feels better because he
has realized how many friends he has around him that support him
and make him "feel loved". Patient denies any suicidal thoughts
currently while on the unit, though still feels sad. 

He reports that the incident with the T train car was not 
something intentional. While he was walking to class on the day 
of his ER presentation, he wasn't paying attention to traffic 
and was in the t tracks as a car was approaching. The car was 
some distance away when the conductor honked at him and he 
walked out of the tracks. He states he is glad he isn't dead but 
he does feel he learned something from the experience so he 
doesn't view it as bad. 

On ROS, patient endorses depressed mood, feelings of guilt over
"letting her go", difficulty sleeping with early morning
awakenings, poor appetite, and poor concentration. He denies any
symptoms of mania such as decreased need for sleep, increased
goal-directed behavior, or grandiosity. He denies any AVH or
paranoid thoughts. Endorses feeling of anxiety but denies any
symptoms of panic. ___ medical review of systems was
negative.

On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout their admission. He was also placed on q15 minute 
checks status on admission and remained on that level of 
observation throughout while being unit restricted. He did not 
require physical or chemical restraints during this 
hospitalization. 

2. PSYCHIATRIC:

Upon admission, the patient reported 3 weeks of depressed mood, 
hopelessness, guilt, poor sleep, low appetite, and poor 
concentration, which occurred in the context of a break up with 
his girlfriend. He also noted 2 weeks of frequent thoughts of SI 
with plan to jump off specific ___ building to the point of 
sending goodbye messages to friend. Pt also incidentally walked 
in front of a train, with thoughts of not moving in order to end 
his life, but jumped out of the way when horn was blown by 
conductor. On arrival to unit, patient was dysphoric but 
hopeful. Patient discussed with treatment team how difficult his 
breakup was for him, and how it affected his self-esteem. 
Patient further discussed his guilt about mistakes he made in 
prior relationships (ex: not being loving enough with family), 
for which he feels responsible to "undo" his mistakes. During 
admission, he completed a Chain Analysis of Problem Behaviors 
and was introspective, increasing his insight about himself, his 
emotions, and his reactions to his emotions. He was able to 
distance himself from the despair and emptiness he felt in the 
setting of his breakup and voiced understanding that feeling 
isolated/alone/rejected can been triggers for negative emotions. 


The patients presentation was concerning for underlying 
adjustment disorder with depressed mood in the context of a 
breakup with his girlfriend. Strong suspicion that patient 
suffers with difficulties with emotional regulation, insecure
attachments (voices difficulties and fears of losing 
relationships), and poor distress tolerance. He identified 
multiple supports on campus that he would utilize, including 
individual therapy, a group therapy, and calling the ___ RA if 
he was in a moment of distress.

The decision was made to not to initiate psychotropic 
medications during this admission, and, instead, encourage group 
and individual therapy. Specifically, focused with patient on 
distress tolerance, identity, self-esteem, and emotion 
regulation. The patient found groups, peer/staff support, and 
individual meetings with treatment team to be helpful for his 
mood. 

At time of discharge, patient had brighter affect. His mood, 
motivation, and self-worth improved and he was able to have 
meaningful discussion about safety planning and how to work on 
his emotional states and distress tolerance.

RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS

On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to himself based upon SI. His risk 
factors noted at that time included age, male gender, SI, recent 
SA, hopelessness, insomnia, recent breakup with his girlfriend. 
___ risk factors were addressed during hospitalization 
via medication management, psychotherapeutic intervention, and 
aftercare coordination.  The patient is being discharged with 
many protective risk factors, including Help-seeking nature, 
strong social supports, no prior history of self-injurious 
behavior/suicide attempts/substance abuse, no access to lethal 
weapons, future
oriented. Given the above, my overall assessment is that the 
patient's suicide risk at time of discharge is moderate.
