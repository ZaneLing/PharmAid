Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 
You were admitted to ___ because of concern for a 
gallstone that was obstructing your common bile duct. You had an 
ERCP procedure to clear the common bile duct. They cleared out 
bile sludge. They found that after they removed the sludge, 
there was still narrowing of the common bile duct. They took 
samples of cells in the bile duct and put in a stent to keep the 
duct open. In 4 weeks, you will need to return for a procedure 
to remove the stent and to look at the surrounding area with an 
ultrasound. 
The pathology from the cells taken from the common bile duct 
should result in about 1 week. You should receive a phone call 
from the gastroenterologists with those results.
You should continue to take your other medications as you had 
been taking them. You should refrain from alcohol use for at 
least a week, if not longer. Your liver function tests are not 
yet normal, but they are improved.
You were also found to have a urinary tract infection. You 
should take the antibiotic as directed (end date will be ___.
Best wishes for your continued healing.
Take care,
Your ___ Care Team
